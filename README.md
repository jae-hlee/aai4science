## 🌍 Overview

The **Agentic AI for Science (AAI4Science) Hackathon 2025** invites participants to **explore and evaluate the capabilities of AI tools** across scientific disciplines.  
This event aims to benchmark how well **agentic AI systems** reason, explain, and generalize across **Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, and Biology (PCMB)** tasks.

### Participating AI Platforms

- [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/)
- [AtomGPT](https://atomgpt.org/)
- [Claude](https://claude.ai/)
- ...and more.

These models can generate insightful and accurate responses, but they also **hallucinate**—producing incorrect outputs with high confidence.  
Understanding, evaluating, and mitigating such behaviors is essential for **trustworthy and reproducible scientific discovery**.

---

## 🧩 Objectives

- Gain hands-on experience with cutting-edge AI tools.  
- Identify and categorize hallucinations (false but confident outputs).  
- Develop and share reproducible test prompts and datasets.  
- Foster open collaboration toward **benchmarking AI for science**.
