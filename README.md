## 🌍 Overview

In this hackathon, participants will **explore and evaluate the capabilities of AI tools** across scientific disciplines.
The event aims to benchmark how well **agentic AI systems** reason, explain, and generalize across **Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, and Biology (PCMB)** tasks.

### Participating AI Platforms

* [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/)
* [AtomGPT](https://atomgpt.org/)
* [Claude](https://claude.ai/) etc.

These models can deliver insightful and accurate answers, but they also **hallucinate**—producing incorrect outputs with high confidence.
Understanding, evaluating, and mitigating such behaviors is key for **trustworthy and reproducible scientific discovery**.

---

## 🧩 Objectives

* Evaluate reasoning and factual accuracy of AI models on PCMB topics.
* Identify and categorize hallucinations (false but confident outputs).
* Develop and share reproducible test prompts and datasets.
* Foster open collaboration toward **benchmarking AI for science**.
